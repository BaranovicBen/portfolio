# Web Projects

This repository contains my web work (think JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, and CSS).  
You can see my most recent project here: **[Lyricy](https://baranovicben.github.io/webProjects/)**

## What is Lyricy?
Lyricy is a simple music player demo featuring timed lyrics and a neon audio visualizer.  
Itâ€™s meant for showcase purposes only.
